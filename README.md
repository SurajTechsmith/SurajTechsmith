## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a **full-stack developer with a strong backend focus**, interested in building **simple, reliable, and scalable systems**.

I work mainly on **backend logic, APIs, and data**, and I also build **frontend interfaces from existing designs**.
My focus is engineering quality: correctness, performance, and maintainability rather than visual design work.
